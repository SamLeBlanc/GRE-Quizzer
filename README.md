# GRE-Quizzer

A terminal-based GRE quizzer that generates pseudo-random questions for the math and vocabulary sections of the GRE. The Quizzer will save scores over many sessions to track the user's progress, allowing them to see trends in their answers. There are various types of math and vocabulary questions whose format is drawn directly from released GRE questions. The Quizzer is very bare-bones, designed by and for Sam because Magoosh is a scam.
